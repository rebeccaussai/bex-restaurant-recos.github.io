Final project details:

1. Created 2 instances for Handlebars
  a. the top div of 11 restaurant tiles had manually curated content
  b. the bottom div of 4 tiles utitilized Google Place ID API to input with name, address, hours, open/closed status
2. I was trying to get the hours for 'today' to appear but didn't end up finishing out this construct to match 'today' with the respective day in google place ID API
tiles animate on hover using jQuery (though I'm not sure why the bottom tiles never worked)
3. the map at the bottom utilizes Google Maps API
4. the markers used custom icons and display the location name on click

Other notes:
1. Used Atom for coding
2. Git in terminal to add/push/commit to Github
3. Github to track commits, collaborate and merge branches
